History of Gnome - FIXME: this title sucks.

(This text is more legible in outline-mode in Emacs.)

Abstract:

The first version of Gnome was first announced around August 1997.
Even before that, it already had a prehistory:  the GIMP was the first
free-as-in-freedom "end-user" application; it had been using its
home-grown GTK+ toolkit for a couple of years, and an enthusiastic
group of people had formed around the toolkit and the GIMP itself.
Come and listen to three veterans of Gnome - the old fogeys - talk
about our early history, our early successes and mistakes, and
hopefully look at pictures, screenshots, and other mementos of old
software which you now use in its ever-evolving form.


Ideas:

* Can we get GIMP 0.54 / 0.6x running?
** I also remember an old photo of a gimp meetup (owen had to have been in it) - surely we can find that

* Can we get really old Gnomes running?

* Screenshots of Gnome's old webpages

** Get them from archive.org

* Screenshots of old Gnome versions

** See Owen's presentation

** Dig up Nat's "Swinging the pendulum"

** Maybe mention Havoc's emails when he started the idea of simplifying Gnome?

* Photos of old Gnome swag:
** OMG! I have a stuffed GEGL!! (dcm)

** Put out a call for mementos from GUADEC Paris, LinuxWorld, etc.

* Eazel's "sorry, we are fucked" sign - eavel.com
** I suppose we shouldnt mention Elliot going to Eazel to teach them how to join the committe and writing half of
   Nautilus? I dont know... its not like they exist.

** "Yes, The Andy Hertzfeld himself was involved in Gnome"
*** I can talk about watching Andy doing a review of OS X before it was released - he didnt like it all

* Photos of Red Hat Labs' multiprocessor Xeon twisting video in real
  time?  "this was considered cutting-edge..."

* MC crashed as you opened a new folder.  But it would restart
  automatically showing all the previous windows and locations, so it
  "just flickered and showed you the right window".

* Bob Young would kill Gnome at Red Hat unless it was shown to work by
  $deadline.  Mad hacking night.
** This is a must - we should probably talk a bunch about how important this was - esp. with kde finally 
   moving to a better license

* Gnome 1.0 launch at Linux World Expo - the press conference that RMS nearly ruined with his "GNU/Linux - not Linux"
  tirade. We should look for those images we made with Gnome running on a bunch of different machine types

* GUADECs - need pictures, etc.

* Virtual machines:

gpoo: federico: btw, I upload the vm for 1.0.53 and 1.2.  However, you
have to edit lilo and boot with 'linux noapic'
gpoo: s/upload/uploaded
gpoo: running 2.2 in a vm is a pain
gpoo: I mean linux 2.2
gpoo: and you have to set -cpu pentium2 in kvm.  Otherwise, it will
crash.

* Old web pages

with screenshots.

* Timeline stuff:

** https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/1997-November/msg00229.html -
GTK+ gets reference counting, for language bindings (Guile, in
particular)

"I'm still tinkering with the reference counting of Gtk.  Below is a
text that describes how I think it should work.  Everything except the
GtkObjects stuff has been implemented and is available as a patch from
ftp.gimp.org as gtk-mvo-971013-0.patch.gz.  I hope to have something
for the GtkObjects soon.

The changes are not backward compatible.  It is possible to install
some support until all major Gtk apps have been converted, I think."

	  plus various fixups and additions from myself.

** Raster says why X doesn't support antialiased fonts:

https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-list/1998-January/msg00282.html
X font primitives cannot be anti-aliased for several reasons. 1. no
alpha support in X.

** Toshok starts implementing antialiased fonts:
   https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-list/1998-January/msg00296.html 

spurred by raster's comments about FnLib and anti-aliased fonts, I've
hacked a font renderer abstraction into gdk.

** JWZ has trouble building Gnome 0.12 on Irix:
Hey there.  I'm trying to build Gnome on Irix 6.3 (SGI O2) and having
a rough time.

** Netscape to go GPL.  Who wants to do a GTK+ port?  It's Motif
   currently:
https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-list/1998-January/msg00117.html

** Can't imagine having a single window manager:

I can't imagine any Linux distribution who is planning on shipping
Gnome by itself, with only one window manager to choose from.  KDE
seem to want a total KDE-branded system/desktop/distribution - but
that's them.

Hello guys,

   Federico and I spent the whole day setting up automake/autoconf for
the new module layout on the CVS tree.  Developers should be able to
continue work now.

   For a minimal developer setup, you only need the new gnome-libs
module and start coding from this.


   The available modules are:

	gnome-admin
	gnome-core
	gnome-games
	gnome-graphics
	gnome-guile
	gnome-libs
	gnome-media
	gnome-network
	gnome-objc
	gnome-utils

- Add support for scrollwheel in GTK+

Re: Could we have mouse-wheel support before the feature freeze ?

"I haven't fooled around with the scroll-wheel in windows,
and I haven't used one myself" (Owen Taylor)
