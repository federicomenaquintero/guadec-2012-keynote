History of Gnome - FIXME: this title sucks.

(This text is more legible in outline-mode in Emacs.)

Abstract:

The first version of Gnome was first announced around August 1997.
Even before that, it already had a prehistory:  the GIMP was the first
free-as-in-freedom "end-user" application; it had been using its
home-grown GTK+ toolkit for a couple of years, and an enthusiastic
group of people had formed around the toolkit and the GIMP itself.
Come and listen to three veterans of Gnome - the old fogeys - talk
about our early history, our early successes and mistakes, and
hopefully look at pictures, screenshots, and other mementos of old
software which you now use in its ever-evolving form.


Ideas:

* Can we get GIMP 0.54 / 0.6x running?
** I also remember an old photo of a gimp meetup (owen had to have been in it) - surely we can find that

* Can we get really old Gnomes running?

* Screenshots of Gnome's old webpages

** Get them from archive.org

* Screenshots of old Gnome versions

** See Owen's presentation

** Dig up Nat's "Swinging the pendulum"

** Maybe mention Havoc's emails when he started the idea of simplifying Gnome?

* Photos of old Gnome swag:
** OMG! I have a stuffed GEGL!! (dcm)

** Put out a call for mementos from GUADEC Paris, LinuxWorld, etc.

* Eazel's "sorry, we are fucked" sign - eavel.com
** I suppose we shouldnt mention Elliot going to Eazel to teach them how to join the committe and writing half of
   Nautilus? I dont know... its not like they exist.

** "Yes, The Andy Hertzfeld himself was involved in Gnome"
*** I can talk about watching Andy doing a review of OS X before it was released - he didnt like it all

* Photos of Red Hat Labs' multiprocessor Xeon twisting video in real
  time?  "this was considered cutting-edge..."

* MC crashed as you opened a new folder.  But it would restart
  automatically showing all the previous windows and locations, so it
  "just flickered and showed you the right window".

* Bob Young would kill Gnome at Red Hat unless it was shown to work by
  $deadline.  Mad hacking night.
** This is a must - we should probably talk a bunch about how important this was - esp. with kde finally 
   moving to a better license

* Gnome 1.0 launch at Linux World Expo - the press conference that RMS nearly ruined with his "GNU/Linux - not Linux"
  tirade. We should look for those images we made with Gnome running on a bunch of different machine types

** Gnome Foundation also announced: 
*** Initial supporters included: IBM, Compaq, Sun, Red Hat, Helix, Eazel, Collab.net
*** Sun had just released "Star Office" and announced that Gnome would
be their default desktop in the near future.
*** That same week: "On Friday, Hewlett-Packard said that it planned to make Linux its third ''strategic'' operating system in addition to Windows and HP-UX, its own version of the Unix operating system."



** The New York Times said of the announcement of Gnome 1.0 and the
   Foundation:

   "The announcements to be made on Tuesday underscore both the
   progress that Linux has made toward becoming a viable alternative
   to Windows and the challenges that remain in persuading business
   and consumer computer users to adopt the free operating system."

  Gnome Steering Committee and moving into the foundation

* Virtual machines:

gpoo: federico: btw, I upload the vm for 1.0.53 and 1.2.  However, you
have to edit lilo and boot with 'linux noapic'
gpoo: s/upload/uploaded
gpoo: running 2.2 in a vm is a pain
gpoo: I mean linux 2.2
gpoo: and you have to set -cpu pentium2 in kvm.  Otherwise, it will
crash.
